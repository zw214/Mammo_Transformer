## Motivation

## Getting Started

First, install the requirements necessary to run the python files.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
As a side note, I used git lfs to upload my large data, but it seems like the data is corrupted. If that is the case in your usage, please download from this [shareable link](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=10-Ba3-WEYg1V8DeSpjUip6BmFdPzt9C7&export=download), and replace this .tfrecords in ```/data/processed/training10_0``` folder. My data processing pipeline will read images from this folder.
